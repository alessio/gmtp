-- v0.3 - 8 Jan 2010

+ gMTP is now relocatable within a filesytem. At startup, it will look at
  the command used to invoke it, and if an absolute path was used, it will
  find it's image data from that otherwise will attempt to find itself in
  the filesystem using the %PATH variable. Just make sure that you copy
  "../share/gMTP/*" to be relative to the binary if moved, otherwise no
  pretty icons. You can override any file paths with --datapath option at
  the CLI. (This was done to allow the SYSV and IPS packages to be
  relocatable). See main.c (last 2 functions) to see how this is done.
  If you know a better way that works everywhere, please let me know.

gMTP - a basic MP3 player client.

Requirements:

gtk+2.0 v2.4+ OR gtk+3.0 (for GNOME 3.0).
Gconf-2.0 OR GSettings (for GNOME 3.0).
libmtp
libid3tag
libusb
libflac (FLAC) v1.2+
libvorbis v1.0.1+

Installation.

For JDS / GNOME 2 platforms (GTK2 + GConf):
$ make
# make install
# make register-gconf-schemas

Note: Use 'gmake' on Solaris and *BSD.
Note: On Solaris 10, you need to logout and back in again once installed.
  (This is a gconf issue on Solaris 10).

For GNOME 3.0 based platforms (GTK3 + GSettings):
$ make gtk3
# make install-gtk3
# make register-gsettings-schemas

If it doesn't compile, check the top of the Makefile for custom CFLAGS.

Note: Solaris 10 does not ship with a PKGCONFIG file for libusb. One can be
found in this package in the 'misc' directory.
Note: libid3tag does not provide a PKGCONFIG file. One can be found in this
package in the 'misc' directory.

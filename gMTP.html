			<h2>A simple MP3 player client for MTP based devices.</h2>
			<p>
				Due to Sun Solaris 10 not having a native MTP based MP3 player support application, 
				I've written my own GUI client for MTP devices. It is very simple, only supporting 
				upload, download and removal of files as needed. For other needs like playlist support,
				I suggest you look at Gnomad2 or another MTP client. (Be aware Gnomad2 does need a very recent GTK/Glib
				version, as well as a few other libraries).
			</p>
			<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Sun Solaris 10, other UNIX or UNIX-like system (should run on Linux and FreeBSD unmodified, but is untested)</li>
				<li>GTK+-2.0 (v2.4.9)</li>
				<li>Glib-2.0 (v2.4.1)</li>
				<li>GConf-2.0 (v2.6.1)</li>
				<li>libmtp (v1.0.0) - http://libmtp.sourceforge.net/ </li>
				<li>libid3tag (v0.15.1b) - http://sourceforge.net/projects/mad/files/ </li>
				<li>libusb (v0.15)</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Installation</h2>
			<h3>libmtp</h3>
			<p>Download the libmtp source code, unpack and run: <code>$ INSTALL=/usr/ucb/install MAKE=gmake ./configure</code></p>
			<p>Note: If you don't have a libusb.pc file (configure complains about libusb being missing), then you can use this 
				<a href="libusb.pc.txt">one</a>. Copy to <code>/usr/lib/pkgconfig/libusb.pc</code>.</p>
			<p>Then normal <code>make</code> and <code>make install</code> routine. </p>
			<p>Once installed, test the mtp package by connecting your MP3 player, and run <code>mtp-detect</code> from a commandline.
				If all is well, you should see your device details scroll across the screen.</p>
			<h3>libid3tag</h3>
			<p>Download the libid3tag source code, unpack and run: <code>$ INSTALL=/usr/ucb/install MAKE=gmake ./configure</code></p>
			<p>Then normal <code>make</code> and <code>make install</code> routine. </p>
			<p>copy <a href="id3tag.pc.txt">id3tag.pc</a> to <code>/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/id3tag.pc</code></p>
			<h3>gMTP</h3>
			<p>Download and unpack the source code, and run the normal <code>make</code> and <code>make install</code> routine.</p>
			<p>run <code>gMTP</code> to start the appication. Feel free to add a launcher to the JDS menu as needed.</p>
			<p>Note: For Solaris10/OpenSolaris, the default makefile assumes you have SunStudio 12 installed. If you don't then modify the make file to use <code>gcc</code> instead. All other OSes will use gcc as default.</p>
			<h2>Downloads</h2>
			<p>
				gMTP Source: <a href="gMTP-0.6-i386.tar.gz">gMTP-0.6-i386.tar.gz</a><br />
				gMTP Solaris 10 Package: <a href="gMTP-0.6-i386.pkg.gz">gMTP-0.6-i386.pkg.gz</a> (Warning: Contains libmtp and libid3tag, please build from source if
				you already have these installed).
			</p>
			<h2>Usage</h2>
			<p>run <code>gMTP</code>. Use the Toolbar buttons for various functions. Files surrounded by "&lt; .. &gt;" are folders, double click to enter. Double clicking
			a file, will download it. Use the Preferences to set upload and download paths. (Note: the last upload/download path is saved when you exit the application).
			Drag'n'Drop support is enabled for uploading files to the device. Simply drop the desired files/folder into gMTP to upload the files/folders to the device.
			</p>
			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<p>Q. What is MTP?<br />
			A. MTP = Media Transfer Protocol. MTP has been adopted by most major MP3 and Mobile Phone manufacturers as the
			method of talking to devices to upload/download files to/from a PC.
			See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol">Media Transfer Protocol</a> for more information.</p>
			<p>Q. Why does&#39;t gMTP support my iPod or Creative Nomad player<br />
			A. These devices do not use MTP for moving data to/from a device. Apple iPod uses it's own custom protocol
			in additional to USB Mass Storage and Creative devices use NJB.</p>
			<p>Q. I have a MTP enabled device and it is connected to my PC, but it doesn't get detected by gMTP?<br />
			A. Most devices are capable of using different modes to talk to your PC, so ensure that the device is in MTP mode.<br />
			A. Or, libmtp doesn't know about your device or how to handle it correctly. Run <code>$ mtp-detect</code> to see
			if it can be found.</p>
			<p>Q. I get asked which storage device to connect to when I connect to my mobile phone?<br />
			A. Some devices (notably mobile phones), have both internal storage (non-removable) and external storage (removable
			storage) in the form of a micro-SD card or M2 card, and gMTP will treat these as different storage devices.</p>
			<p>Q. Does gMTP support Albums and uploading Album Art?<br />
			A. Yes. Album data is autocreated/updated when you upload a MP3 (or other supported audio file) by using information
			contained within the audio file, eg. Using the ID3 Tag information in an MP3 file. Once the Album has been created,
			you can upload the album art via the <code>Edit</code> / <code>Add Album Art</code> menu option.</p>
			<p>Q. Will this software work on OpenSolaris, Linux, *BSD or other POSIX Operating System<br />
			A. It should work fine but is untested. </p>
			<p>Q. What about SPARC, ARM or other non-x86 systems?<br />
			A. It should work fine but is untested. (If libmtp and libid3tag work fine on your platform, then gMTP should as well).</p>
			<p>Q. Do I need root access to use gMTP?<br />
			A. On Solaris 10, in general No. (If you do need root access, then double check your RBAC setup for your user then). On Linux, in general No, as libmtp
			should have set your udev rules correctly for libmtp known devices.</p>
			<p>Q. I have uploaded FLAC and/or OGG files to my MP3 player, and they don't show up as tracks on my player?<br />
			A. I've yet to add in support for FLAC and OGG metadata, so I can give the player the correct information. (Patches welcome).</p>

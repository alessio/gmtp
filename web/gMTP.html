                <h3><a id="Home" >A simple MP3 player client for MTP based devices.</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Due to Oracle Solaris 10 not having a native MTP based MP3 player support application,
                    I've written my own GUI client for MTP devices. It supports:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Upload, Download, Removal, Renaming and Moving of files as needed.</li>
                    <li>Drag'n'Drop support for uploading files to the device.</li>
                    <li>Folder Creation and Deletion.</li>
                    <li>Album Art management.</li>
                    <li>Metadata support for MP3, WMA, OGG and FLAC audio files, ensuring correct track information
                        on your media player when uploading audio files.</li>
                    <li>Device Naming support.</li>
                    <li>Basic creation, editing and deletion of playlists. Able to import and export playlists
                        in *.m3u format.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For other needs like managing your audio collection or ripping CDs I suggest you look at
                    another full featured media application.</p>

                <p class="align_center">
                    <img src="Help1.png" title="gMTP Toolbar" alt="Toolbar" /></p>
                <p>
                    The main Toolbar contains the main functions available for using MTP based devices, or alternative use the main
                    menu or right click on the file area to gain access to basic file operations. All of these are self described.</p>
                <h3>Working with Files and Folders</h3>
                <p>
                    The default view of the device, is to list all files and folders within the main window. Different columns
                    for display may be chosen from the <code>View</code> menu. Below is a screen shot of all the different icons
                    that are shown within gMTP to signify different file types.</p>
                <p class="align_center">
                    <img src="Help2.png" title="gMTP File Area" alt="Folder" /></p>
                <p>
                    Starting from the top these are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Folders</li>
                    <li>Generic Files</li>
                    <li>Plain text Files</li>
                    <li>Playlist Files</li>
                    <li>Multimedia Files</li>
                    <li>Audio Files</li>
                    <li>Album Information Files</li>
                    <li>Image Files</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    All file operations can be accessed from the <code>File</code> menu, or alternatively, right clicking within the
                    view area. Double clicking on a file will download it to your PC/Laptop, and double clicking on a folder will access
                    the contents of the folder. Folders with <code>..</code> let you move up in the folder structure, (go back to the
                    previous folder).</p>
                <p>
                    Drag'n'Drop support is enabled for uploading files to the device. Simply drop the desired files/folder
                    into gMTP to upload the files/folders to the device.</p>
                <h3>Preferences</h3>
                <p class="align_center">
                    <img src="Help3.png" title="gMTP Preferences" alt="Preferences" /></p>
                <p>
                    Application preferences may be accessed via the toolbar, or through the <code>Edit > Preferences</code> menu.
                    Use the Preferences to set upload and download paths. (Note: the last upload/download path is saved when you
                    exit the application).</p>
                <h3>Playlists</h3>
                <p>
                    gMTP is able to import and export playlists in m3u format, with some restrictions. These restrictions are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>EXTM3U tags and information is ignored.</li>
                    <li>A "#GMTPPLA: " tag can be used to set the playlist name. This tag may exist anywhere in the file.
                        For example to set the playlist name to "Good Songs", then use "<code>#GMTPPLA: Good Songs</code>"
                        within the m3u file on it's own line. If this tag is not found, then the m3u filename is used as the
                        playlist name (minus the "m3u" file extension).</li>
                    <li>All paths indicated within the m3u playlist file are expected to be relative based on the file
                        location within your MTP device, and NOT relative to the location of the m3u file itself within
                        the PC local filesystem. You may set the "Ignore path information when importing playlist"
                        setting in preferences so that gMTP will ignore any file path information and search all folders
                        for the music file.</li>
                    <li>All files indicated within the m3u must exist within the current mounted storage device for those
                        devices that support or have multiple storage pools. (eg Mobile Phones, Tablets).</li>
                    <li>If no files are located on the device as indicated within the m3u playlist file, then the playlist
                        will not be created.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2><a id="FAQ">FAQ</a></h2>
                <p><span class="question">Q. What is MTP?</span><br />
                    A. MTP = Media Transfer Protocol. MTP has been adopted by most major MP3 and Mobile Phone manufacturers as the
                    method of talking to devices to upload/download files to/from a PC.
                    See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol">Media Transfer Protocol</a> for more information.</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. Why doesn&#39;t gMTP support my iPod or Creative Nomad player</span><br />
                    A. These devices do not use MTP for moving data to/from a device. Apple iPod uses it's own custom protocol
                    in additional to USB Mass Storage and Creative devices use NJB.</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. I have a MTP enabled device and it is connected to my PC, but it doesn't get detected by gMTP?</span><br />
                    A. Most devices are capable of using different modes to talk to your PC, so ensure that the device is in MTP mode.<br />
                    A. Or, libmtp doesn't know about your device or how to handle it correctly. Run <code>$ mtp-detect</code> to see
                    if it can be found.<br />
                    A. Occasionally, some devices become confused if you connect and disconnect them in gMTP, but do not physically
                    disconnect/reconnect them. In this instance, close gMTP, physically disconnect and reconnect the device, and
                    restart gMTP. It should connect.</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. I have a MTP enabled device, it connects, but gMTP crashes or the device resets?</span><br />
                    A. There may be a bug in gMTP or libmtp that is causing the crash. Please file a bug report with the gMTP project ticket system
                    and it will be looked at.<br />
                    A. Some MTP implementations on devices are horribly broken, or have known issues with libmtp. Unfortunately there
                    is little that can be done about these devices except complaining to the device vendor to test their device on UNIX with
                    libmtp as the connection library.</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. Do you have a list of devices that work with gMTP?</span><br />
                    A. Unfortunately no. (I test with an iRiver Clix 2G and Sony Ericsson K800i phone, and both of these work extremely well).</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. I get asked which storage device to connect to when I connect to my mobile phone?</span><br />
                    A. Some devices (notably mobile phones), have both internal storage (non-removable) and external storage (removable
                    storage) in the form of a micro-SD card or M2 card, and gMTP will treat these as different storage devices.</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. Does gMTP support Albums and uploading Album Art?</span><br />
                    A. Yes. Album data is autocreated/updated when you upload a MP3 (or other supported audio file) by using information
                    contained within the audio file, eg. Using the ID3 Tag information in an MP3 file. Once the Album has been created,
                    you can upload the album art via the <code>Edit</code> / <code>Album Art</code> menu option.</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. Will this software work on OpenSolaris, Linux, *BSD or other POSIX Operating System</span><br />
                    A. I have reports that it runs successfully on OpenSolaris, Arch Linux, Debian and Ubuntu. </p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. What about SPARC, ARM or other non-x86 systems?</span><br />
                    A. It should work fine but is untested. (If libmtp and libid3tag work fine on your platform, then gMTP should as well).</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. Do I need root access to use gMTP?</span><br />
                    A. On Solaris 10, in general No. (If you do need root access, then double check your RBAC setup for your user
                    then). On Linux, in general No, as libmtp
                    should have set your udev rules correctly for libmtp known devices.</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. In the file view or playlist editor, tracks have a length of 0:00?</span><br />
                    A. The length field displayed is reliant on the track data being set correctly when the audio file was uploaded. Some
                    file transfer utilities do not set this information correctly (and earlier versions of gMTP are also guilty of this). Simply download
                    and re-upload the audio file using gMTP to correct the track data on the player.</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. I have the same audio file loaded on my device in different formats, but the song duration is
                        different between them.</span><br />
                    A. WMA, FLAC and OGG all store the song duration in header information, and this is set by the encoder used to create
                    the file. It may be a bug with the encoder? With MP3 files, the track duration is calculated when the file is uploaded,
                    so this information should be correct unless you have a corrupt MP3 file.</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. The translations are pretty awful or just plain wrong, or why don't you have xyz language?</span><br />
                    A. The initial translations were done using Google Translate services, so accuracy is not 100%. Please email me with
                    corrections to existing translations. If you would like a particular language added, and are happy to assist, please
                    let me know or simply email me with the correct *.po file with the translations for your language.</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. I'm using French Canadian (fr_CA.UTF-8) as my locale on Solaris 10, but I don't get French
                        translations?</span><br />
                    A. This is due to an idiosyncrasy on Solaris 10 and language translations. Either:</p>
                <ol><li>Copy the gmtp.mo file from /usr/local/share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES to /usr/local/share/locale/fr_CA.UTF-8/LC_MESSAGES,
                        and restart gmtp.</li>
                    <li>or, create a symlink fr_CA.UTF-8 pointing to fr in /usr/local/share/locale using 'ln -s fr fr_CA.UTF-8'.</li></ol>
                <p>French translations should now be present. (Technical information:
                    On Solaris, the gettext() call will only look in the current locale folder as defined by the LC_MESSAGES environment
                    variable and not the base language folder as well for translations, so if the locale is set to 'fr_CA.UTF-8', gettext()
                    will only look in that locale folder and not 'fr' as well - which is what the GNU version of gettext() does). This
                    applies to all languages on Solaris 10. For Linux/FreeBSD uses this should not be an issue as most will use the GNU
                    version of gettext().</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. The column view options do not appear to be working?</span><br />
                    A. The gconf schema was updated in v0.8. Please update your local schema file.</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. I'm attempting to install gMTP from source and it's complaining about missing files?</span><br />
                    A. Please ensure all dependencies have been installed prior to attempting to build gMTP.<br />
                    A. Some operating systems separate header packages (needed to build software) from the main software component package.
                    Please ensure these are installed as well.<br />
                    A. On some Linux distributions, id3tag is installed without a matching PKGCONFIG file which is required to build gMTP.
                    An example id3tag.pc file can be found on the Installation page, under 'id3tag'.
                </p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. I'm attempting to move some files, and I always get an error. What's the issue?</span><br />
                    A. gMTP uses the MTP function 'moveObject' to perform move operations. However only a few devices actually support this
                    function, and if they do actually advertise it supports the function, it may be horribly broken. Basically complain to 
                    your device manufacturer that it doesn't support this function, and that they should add it in, since it is actually part 
                    of the MTP Specification. To see if your device has this option available, run 'mtp-detect' and look under the supported 
                    commands for command '1019: MoveObject'. The other method I could use is to download the files/folders to your PC, 
                    re-upload them again and delete the originals, however this is very time intensive, and in these cases it's better than 
                    the user do this themselves.
                </p>
                <p><span class="question">Q. I have an Android device and .... isn't working?</span><br />
                    A. There are a few answers or explanations with Android.</p>
                    <ol><li> Some device vendors have opted to use their own MTP software stack with
                            their device, and some of these implementations are horribly broken.
                            Contact your device manufacturer for further assistance. (AFAIK, this is
                            primarily Samsung with Android 2.x devices, and some lesser known Chinese
                            developed handsets often rebadged as Carrier own-brand handsets).</li>
                        <li>Android 1.x-2.x doesn't have a native MTP implementation, so if your
                            device has MTP functionality, see the above comment.</li>
                        <li>Android 3.x-4.x has native MTP functionality, but is missing some features
                            and does have some bugs in the implementation. Some noted issues:
                        <ol><li>Does not support albums or album metadata. So you can't upload custom
                                album art.</li>
                            <li>Some users have reported issues with Playlist support. (Try to get a
                                newer revision of your version of Android).</li>
                            <li>Android 3.2 has a nasty bug, in that an application is unable to 
                                call the Storage APIs more than once in a session. gMTP 1.3.2+ works 
                                around this by caching the device storage information. (but not the 
                                file listing or related metadata).</li>
                            <li>Samsung Galaxy and Google Nexus devices have connectivity issues, that I'm
                                hoping can be resolved via patches to libmtp. Sorry, there is nothing I 
                                can do about that situation. Complain to Samsung and Google, and try to
                                get them actively involved in libmtp.</li></ol>
                        </li>

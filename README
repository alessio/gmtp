FAQ

Q. What is MTP?
A. MTP = Media Transfer Protocol. MTP has been adopted by most major MP3 and 
   Mobile Phone manufacturers as the method of talking to devices to
   upload/download files to/from a PC. See
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol for more information.

Q. Why does't gMTP support my iPod or Creative Nomad player
A. These devices do not use MTP for moving data to/from a device. Apple iPod 
   uses it's own custom protocol in additional to USB Mass Storage and Creative
   devices use NJB.

Q. I have a MTP enabled device and it is connected to my PC, but it doesn't get
   detected by gMTP?
A. Most devices are capable of using different modes to talk to your PC, so
   ensure that the device is in MTP mode.
A. Or, libmtp doesn't know about your device or how to handle it correctly.
   Run $ mtp-detect to see if it can be found.

Q. I get asked which storage device to connect to when I connect to my mobile
   phone?
A. Some devices (notably mobile phones), have both internal storage
   (non-removable) and external storage (removable storage) in the form of a
   micro-SD card or M2 card, and gMTP will treat these as different storage
   devices.

Q. Will this software work on OpenSolaris, Linux, *BSD or other POSIX Operating
   System
A. I have reports that it runs successfully on OpenSolaris, Arch Linux, Debian
   and Ubuntu.

Q. What about SPARC, ARM or other non-x86 systems?
A. It should work fine but is untested. (If libmtp and libid3tag work fine on
   your platform, then gMTP should as well).

Q. Do I need root access to use gMTP?
A. On Solaris 10, in general No. (If you do need root access, then double
   check your RBAC setup for your user then). On Linux, in general No, as libmtp
   should have set your udev rules correctly.


TODO List

1. Basic Playlist support. (Still need to think about the best way to do this).
2. More audio file type metadata if requested.

gMTP v1.3.0

A basic MP3 Player client for Oracle Solaris 10.

Supports MTP devices including those with multiple storage devices
(typically mobile phones). Supports Drag'n'Drop interface for
upload/download of files.

See INSTALL for build/install instructions.

FAQ

Q. What is MTP?
A. MTP = Media Transfer Protocol. MTP has been adopted by most major MP3 and 
   Mobile Phone manufacturers as the method of talking to devices to
   upload/download files to/from a PC. See
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol for more information.

Q. Why doesn't gMTP support my iPod or Creative Nomad player?
A. These devices do not use MTP for moving data to/from a device. Apple iPod 
   uses it's own custom protocol in additional to USB Mass Storage and Creative
   devices use NJB.

Q. I have a MTP enabled device and it is connected to my PC, but it doesn't get
   detected by gMTP?
A. Most devices are capable of using different modes to talk to your PC, so
   ensure that the device is in MTP mode.<br />
A. Or, libmtp doesn't know about your device or how to handle it correctly. 
   Run '$ mtp-detect' to see if it can be found.

Q. I get asked which storage device to connect to when I connect to my mobile
   phone?
A. Some devices (notably mobile phones), have both internal storage 
   (non-removable) and external storage (removable storage) in the form of a
   micro-SD card or M2 card, and gMTP will treat these as different storage
   devices.

Q. Does gMTP support Albums and uploading Album Art?
A. Yes. Album data is autocreated/updated when you upload a MP3 (or other 
   supported audio file) by using information contained within the audio file,
   eg. Using the ID3 Tag information in an MP3 file. Once the Album has been
   created, you can upload the album art via the 'Edit / Album Art' menu
   option.

Q. Will this software work on OpenSolaris, Linux, *BSD or other POSIX Operating 
   System?
A. I have reports that it runs successfully on OpenSolaris, Arch Linux, Debian
   and Ubuntu.

Q. What about SPARC, ARM or other non-x86 systems?
A. It should work fine but is untested. (If libmtp and libid3tag work fine on
   your platform, then gMTP should as well).

Q. Do I need root access to use gMTP?
A. On Solaris 10, in general No. (If you do need root access, then double check
   your RBAC setup for your user then). On Linux, in general No, as libmtp
   should have set your udev rules correctly for libmtp known devices.

Q. In the file view or playlist editor, tracks have a length of 0:00?
A. The length field displayed is reliant on the track data being set correctly
   when the audio file was uploaded. Some file transfer utilies do not set this
   information correctly (and earlier versions of gMTP are also guilty of this).
   Simply download and re-upload the audio file using gMTP to correct the track
   data on the player.

Q. I have the same audio file loaded on my device in different formats, but the 
   song duration is different between them?
A. WMA, FLAC and OGG all store the song duration in header information, and
   this is set by the encoder used to create the file. It may be a bug with the
   encoder? With MP3 files, the track duration is calculated when the file is
   uploaded, so this information should be correct unless you have a corrupt
   MP3 file.

Q. The translations are pretty awful or just plain wrong, or why don't you have
   xyz language?
A. The initial translations were done using Google Translate services, so
   accuracy is not 100%. Please email me with corrections to existing
   translations. If you would like a particular language added, and are happy
   to assist, please let me know or simply email me with the correct *.po file
   with the translations for your langauge.

Q. I'm using French Canadian (fr_CA.UTF-8) as my locale on Solaris 10, but I
   don't get French translations?
A. This is due to an idiosyncrasy on Solaris 10 and language translations.
   Either:
   1. Copy the gmtp.mo file from /usr/local/share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES to
   /usr/local/share/locale/fr.UTF-8/LC_MESSAGES, and restart gmtp.
   2. or, create a symlink fr.UTF-8 pointing to fr in /usr/local/share/locale
   using 'ln -s fr fr.UTF-8'.

   French translations should now be present. (Technical information: On
   Solaris, the gettext() call will only look in the current locale folder as
   defined by the LC_MESSAGES environment variable and not the base language
   folder as well for translations, so if the locale is set to 'fr.UTF-8',
   gettext() will only look in that locale folder and not 'fr' as well - which
   is what the GNU version of gettext() does). This applies to all languages
   on Solaris 10. For Linux/FreeBSD uses this should not be an issue as most
   will use the GNU version of gettext().

Q. The column view options do not appear to be working?
A. The gconf schema was updated in v0.8. Please update your local schema
   file.
   
Q. I'm attempting to move some files, and I always get an error. What's the 
   issue?
A. gMTP uses the MTP function 'moveObject' to perform move operations. 
   However only a few devices actually support this function, and if they
   do actually advertise it supports the function, it may be horribly
   broken. Basically complain to your device manufacturer that it doesn't
   support this function, and that they should add it in.
   To see if you device has this option available, run 'mtp-detect' and look
   under the supported commands for command '1019: MoveObject'.
   The other method I could use is to download the files/folders to your
   PC, re-upload them again and delete the originals, however this is very
   time intensive, and in these cases it's better than the user do this 
   themselves.

TODO List

1. Bugfixes as needed.
2. Further translations.
